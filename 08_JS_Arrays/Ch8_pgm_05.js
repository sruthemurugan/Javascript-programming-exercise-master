/* Further Adventures
 *
 * 1) Run the report for Friday.
 *
 * 2) Update the function to include Saturday and Sunday.
 *
 * A month of visitor info could be represented as an
 * array of arrays: [ week1, week2, week3, week4 ]
 * where each week could be an array of visitor numbers.
 *
 * 3) Write a new function with three parameters,
 *    the month array, the week wanted and the day wanted.
 *    The new function should return the visitor report specified.
 *    You can call getVisitorReport from your function if you want.
 *
 * 4) Create four arrays of week visitor numbers
 *    and a month array of the four weeks.
 *    Test your function from 3) for different weeks and days.
